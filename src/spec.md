# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add admin login functionality directly on the dashboard landing page for easier access.

**Planned changes:**
- Add LoginButton component to DashboardPage.tsx in a prominent location (top-right area or header)
- Ensure button shows appropriate authentication states (logged in/logged out)
- Make button responsive for mobile and desktop viewports

**User-visible outcome:** Users can log in as admin directly from the dashboard landing page without navigating to other pages, and access admin features after authentication.
