# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Sort income entries by newest date first in the entries table.

**Planned changes:**
- Modify backend getEntries query to return entries sorted by date in descending order
- Ensure frontend displays entries in the order received from backend without additional sorting

**User-visible outcome:** Income entries will appear with the newest entries at the top of the table.
